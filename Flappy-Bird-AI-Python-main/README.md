# Flappy-Bird-Python
Flappy Bird Game in Python
Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. It offers two versions: a Non-AI version where the player manually controls the bird's movement, and an AI version implemented using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, where the bird's movement is controlled by a neural network.

AI Version:
Utilizes NEAT, a genetic algorithm for evolving artificial neural networks, to train the bird to play the game autonomously.
The NEAT algorithm dynamically adjusts the bird's neural network, allowing it to learn and improve its performance over time.
Provides a fascinating demonstration of evolutionary computation in action, showcasing how AI can be trained to tackle complex tasks.
