# Flappy Bird Game in Python

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. It offers two versions: a Non-AI version where the player manually controls the bird's movement, and an AI version implemented using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, where the bird's movement is controlled by a neural network.

## Features

### Non-AI Version:

- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay where the player controls the bird's altitude by tapping the spacebar.
- Simple and intuitive controls suitable for players of all ages.
- Basic graphics and sound effects faithful to the original game.

### AI Version:

- Utilizes NEAT, a genetic algorithm for evolving artificial neural networks, to train the bird to play the game autonomously.
- The NEAT algorithm dynamically adjusts the bird's neural network, allowing it to learn and improve its performance over time.
- Provides a fascinating demonstration of evolutionary computation in action, showcasing how AI can be trained to tackle complex tasks.
